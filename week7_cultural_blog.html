<div id="content">

  <p>The Cultural values that I had noted as most impprtant to me were: 
  <br>

  <ul <span style="color:orange">
<li>Accomplishment</li>
<li>Personal development</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Status</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Money</li>

  </ul>

</p>

<p>One of the things that I mentioned in my Stereotype threat blog entry was how I was very conscious to express my opinions in a public forum. I had a tendency to hold back on voicing my opinions due to the fear of being perceived the wrong way. I think the values that really helped me were my sense of Competition and my constant goal of personal development. These two values pushed me to do better in everything I did and not give up. I wasn't worried anymore about other people's opinion anymore, but just focused on what I needed to go to reach my goal.
<p>One of things I would do when I am feeling down at DBC is remembering the primary reason why I joined DBC: the goal of improving my skills and learn something new that will provide me better and challenging opportunities. I certainly believe the values I mentioned above will help me overcome anytime I feel down at DBC.</p>
