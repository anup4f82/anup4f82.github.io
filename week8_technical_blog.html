<p>Rails is a Open Source Web application Framwork that uses the 'Ruby' programming language. Ruby on Rails has become a popular Web Development framweork in recent years because it enables rapid development. It is a Full-stack framweork that allows creating webpages,query the databases and gather information from the web server. Rails combines Ruby programming language along with HTML,CSS & Javascript and delivers a web application that runs on web server.</p>


<p> Rails framwork follows two principles: D.R.Y(Don't Repeat Yourself) and Convention over configuration. D.R.Y simply means don't write the same information over and over again. Rails emphasizes on a certain way to do things defaulting to certain conventions. Without a Web application framework it is tough ask to develop web applications with the necessary infrastucture. Even with a Web application framework, a developer could take his or her own approach and build an application. The good thing about Rails is since there is only one best way to implement a framework, any web application built on Rails can easily be understood by another Rails Developer. This means collaboration is easier and development is quicker.
</p>

<p> At its core, Rails follows the Model-View-Controller framework also known as MVC. It categorizes  a web application into three sections: the model, the controller and the the view. The model handles the databse calls, controller handles all the web server interaction and the view generates the HTML code that is  displayed in the browser. Following the MVC Model helps keep everything in place and makes developing complex web applications easier.


<p>Hope you guys got some valuable information on Rails framework from my blog. If you want to read up more on Rails and why it is so popular I found a good resource: http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html</p>
