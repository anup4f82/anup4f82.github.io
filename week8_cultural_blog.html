<div id="content">

  <p>I feel that DBC's culture of working together as a group and not treating it as a 'commodity' is something that resonates with me. At my last job, my manager would encourage a similar habit amongst us. He would emphasize on helping each other out: working as a group. I have also observed that while working in a group dynamic, be it guiding the other person or working on a collective goal, everyone learns something new at the end of the process.</p><p>There have been other coding classes that I have attended, but unfortunately have not learnt anything significant that I could use at work or market myself with those skills. The one aspect of DBC that I like is the practical application of the knowledge I am gaining. The best way of learning to code is to write the code yourself - write,test,debug and fix. This is the only way to learn to code successfully. Also I like the fact that DBC is a intensive full-time course. To become a good Developer that can actually build an application from scratch, fix and re-factor another Developer's code  and be technically skilled enough to be considered by a company , I feel such amount of time and effort is required.</p>

    <p> In the end I would like to say that I am really excited and looking forward  to be a part of DBC and want to make the most out of it and propel my career in Software Development.</p>
