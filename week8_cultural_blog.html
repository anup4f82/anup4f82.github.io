<div id="content">

  <p>I feel that DBC's culture of working together as a group and not treating it as a 'commodity' is really cool. At my last Job, our Manager tried to cultivate a similar habit amongst us. He would emphasize on helping each other out, working as a group . I have also seen when you work with another person whether you are guiding the person ,learning from them or collectively doing something, I always end up learning something new at the end of it. I  have been to other coding classes where at the end of the class I didn't really learn enough that I could use it at work and get paid for it. The one thing I like about DBC is its more practical oriented. When it comes to coding, unless you write the code yourself, you are never going to learn. Also I like the fact that DBC is a intensive full-time course. To become a Developer in two months, I feel such amount of time and effort is required.

    <p> In the end I would like to say that I am really excited and looking forward  to be a part of DBC and want to make the most out of it and propel my career in Software Development.</p>
