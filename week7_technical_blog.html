<p>SQL Injection is a way used by Hackers to steal Data from companies that host Web applications. It is a technique used by hackers wherein they insert
cleverly constructed SQL Statements into a user input form that will get them user Data like usernames,password,Account no's etc. This poses a serious threat to the Customer's that have their Data stored in the company's Database. Especially in Financial and Banking Web applications such a attack will prove detrimental since the hacker could potentially access the User's Bank Account details! A hacker could also use SQL Injection to wipe out a complete Table. </p>
<p>Let's see some examples of how a hacker can use simple SQL statements to get access to an application's Database or wipe out a Table from the Database:</p>
<h2> SQL Injection : 1 = 1 Always True</h2>
<p><div id = "sql1">Select Name,Password from users where user_id = 101 OR 1 = 1</div></p>
<p> In the above example, 1 = 1 will always evaluate to true, thus giving a list of all Names and passwords in the users table!. A Hacker will just have to input user_id = 101 OR 1 = 1 in the input box and hack the system!</p>
<h2> SQL Injections: WHERE ""="" is Always TRUE</h2>
<p><div id = "sql1">Select Name,Password from users where Name = "ABC" OR ""=""</div></p>
<p> In the above example, WHERE ""="" is always going to be true since "=" = "=", thus giving the hacker access to all the User Data.</p>
<h2> SQL Injections: Batched SQL Statements</h2>
<p><div id = "sql1">Select * from users;Drop Table users</div></p>
<p> In the above example, the hacker can input something like 101;DROP Table users in the input form, which will execute the Statements -
Select * from users;DROP Table users against the users table, thus wiping out the entire table!</p>
<h2> Prevent SQL Injection:</h2>
<p> I have noted below two ways to prevent SQL Injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:orange"><strong>Constrain Input:</strong></span> This is as simple as having field validations for length,type,format and range. Having these validations will throw an error when a user enters a SQL statement in the user input field.</li>
<li><span style="color:orange"><strong>SQL parameter for Data Access</strong></span> In this case, the user input is passed onto a Stored proecedure that will execute the SQL Statement and the User input. In this case the parameter is treated as a literal value and not as a 'executable code'. The parameter is also checked for its length and type.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a couple of examples to avoid SQL Injection attacks. There are more secure and fullproof ways to avoid SQL Injections. </p>
