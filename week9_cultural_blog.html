  <p>My thinking style is Concrete sequential. After doing some research I found the below qualities for Concrete sequential thinkers: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent and product oriented</li>
        <li>"by the numbers" person</li>
            <li>list-maker</li>
                <li>Practical and Detail oriented</li>
                  <li>Instinctive,methodical,deliberate and structured</li>
                    <li>Environmental preference: ordered,practical,quiet and stable</li>
                      <li>Approach to life: Realistic,patient,conservative</li>
                   
  </ul>

  <p> After reading the qualities , I do relate to some of them. Anthony Gregorc has mentioned that no one has a 'pure' style which I agree to since I don't have some of the qualities listed above. Anthony Gregorc has mentioned a concrete sequential thinker likes Order,logical sequence and following directions. The way DBC has laid out the Phase 0 course structure with specific directions and sequence definitely helped me. I like getting directions and then working towards completing it. It helps me plan things accordingly. I also work better when I am put under pressure. I like the fact that DBC holds us accountable if we are not upto par. This drives me to work harder so I can learn and finish my work on time.<p>Concrete sequential thinkers find it hard to:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Work in groups</li>
    <li>Discussion with no specific point</li>

    <li>Work in unorganized environment</li>
    <li>Following incomplete or unclear directions</li>
    <li>Working with unpredictable people</li>
    <li>Dealing with abstract ideas</li>
    <li>Demands to use your imagination</li>

  </ul>

  <p>I can relate to some of the above qualities. Often at times I like to work on my own. I feel I can think and come up with solutions faster when I do it by myself. The pair programming sessions though have really helped me to break this barrier. All my pairs have been really patient and supportive. I am sure as I have more pair programming sessions at DBC I will work better in groups and excel at DBC</p>

  <p>I am positive that I will be able to adapt at DBC and learn and improve my technical skills. This is a new phase in my life and a huge commitment on my part. I want to make this experience as productive as I can and I am sure with help of my peers and DBC I will achieve my goals.</p>


  </ul>
