  <p>My thinking style is Concrete sequential. After doing some research I found the below qualities for Concrete sequential thinkers: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent and product oriented</li>
        <li>"by the numbers" person</li>
            <li>list-maker</li>
                <li>Practical and Detail oriented</li>
                  <li>Instinctive,methodical,deliberate and structured</li>
                    <li>Environmental preference: ordered,practical,quiet and stable</li>
                      <li>Approach to life: Realistic,patient,conservative</li>
                   
  </ul>

  <p> After reading the qualities , I do relate to some of them. Anthony Gregorc has mentioned that no one has a 'pure' style which I agree to since I don't have some of the qualities listed above. Anthony Gregorc has mentioned a concrete sequential thinker likes Order,logical sequence and following directions. They way DBC has layed out the Phase 0 course structure with specific directions and sequence definitley helped me. I like getting directions and then working towards completing it. It helps me plan things accordingly. <p>Concrete sequential thinkers find it hard to:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Work in groups</li>
    <li>Discussion with no specific point</li>

    <li>Work in unorganized environment</li>
    <li>Following incomplete or unclear directions</li>
    <li>Working with unpredictable people</li>
    <li>Dealing with abstract ideas</li>
    <li>Demands to use your imagination</li>

  </ul>

  <p>I can relate to some of the above qualities. I am a kind of person who likes to work on his own. I feel I can think and come up with solutions faster when I do it by myself. For some of the pairing sessions I felt I wasn't quick enough to understand concepts or come up with a solution. After the pairing session, when I tried doing it by myself, it clicked immdiately. This is one aspect that I want to improve on and get better at working in groups so I can excel at DBC. </p>

  <p>Since I like Order and structure and following directions, I am sure it will help me at DBC to learn. I also like the fact that DBC is more practical oriented and I know I learn quicker that way. I also am sure I will be able to adapt to working in groups and figuring how to solve problems together.</p>


  </ul>
