<h1>JavaScript: Why is it So Popular</h1>

<p>Javascript has taken the web world by storm over the last decade. Today every other web page you visit is loaded with Javascript. It has enabled web pages to be more interactive and dynamic to the users. When you add Javacript to your HTML page, the page doesn't need to interact with the Server to get information. The interactions with Javascript happen on the Client side. This reduces the page load time and improves performance. </p><br>

<p>One of the main advantages of javascript is the langauge itself is very easy to learn and clean compared to other programming languages. This means any web developer can learn it and apply it to his or her work. Almost ever browser provides tools so you can easily debug your javascript code and also look at javascript code for any browser you are interested in. My first interaction with Javascript was at work when we had impelemented 'Site analytics' which tells us how many users came to our site,select a product and add it in the shopping cart, how many users abandon the shopping cart etc. This Data was then used by Marketing & the Design team to structure the site in a different way. This helped us getting more Sales! Pretty impressive.  </p><br>

<p>Some of the areas where Javascript is used in today's web sites are:

	<ul>
		<li>Alerting user when they take certain actions on the page</li>
		<li>Checking if a user-name is available right when you type it</li>
		<li>Showing you suggested results as you type</li>
		<li>Re-loading information on the page as it gets updated. e.g: Sports scores</li>
		<li>Page Animation</li>
	</ul>


	</p>
 
<p> As you can see from the above Javascript is the reason why we love today's web pages so much and keep visitng them. Javascript has abundant ways to make web browsing a pleasurable experience and it is going to keep evolving in years to come.
