<h2>My Favourite sites</h2>




<p>
	<span style="color:orange"><strong>Yahoo.com:-</strong></span>This is the site I visit most often.What I like about Yahoo is the 'hover'feature that allows you to hover your mouse on the image and it displays the news piece.Here is a screenshot of the 'hover feature'.The 'Trending now' section shows you all the breaking news at one glance. The site covers a huge spectrum of topics - News to sports to weather etc. The site never has a dull or lull moment. There is always something new to see and read!It is interesting how the news pieces have been organized. It doesn't use the typical hierarchy of news site where political /economical stories are given highest importance and social / entertainment stories are often treated like smaller, lesser important stories. Yahoo organizes stories according to what people are reading the most right now rather than the former.Although the site has a lot of information and links, It is very well organized and structured. I visit this site regularly to read the news, movie reviews and I always find something interesting to read on the site.

	<span style="color:orange"><strong>Expedia (Mobile App):-</strong></span> I find this app super cool and easy to use. It has nice images. Booking Hotel and flights is very easy.I havent used their site as much.The Expedia app shows how images can have an effect on the site and make it look nicer.I admit I have booked couple of times on Expedia just to try out the app! I didnt really want to go anywhere. I would highly recommend anyone to try out the expedia app.

	<span style="color:orange"><strong>NBA.com:-</strong></span> Well I don't know if I like this site because I like sports or the site itself, but this is the site I am on all the time. They have all the scores below the Header area. They show all the breaking news right below the scores followed by videos of the latest games.The Standings page also has a nice tabular section showing the latest rankings.The scores and Schedules section shows all the scores of completed and ongoing games. Just looking at the how the score is displayed seems like a lot of HTML Code!.
