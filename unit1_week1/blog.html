<h2>My Favourite sites</h2>

<p>
	<span style="color:orange"><strong>Yahoo.com:-</strong></span>This is the site I visit most often.What I like about Yahoo is the 'hover'feature that allows you to hover your mouse on the image and it displays the news piece.The 'Trending now' section shows you breaking news at one glance.It has numerous links to go to different sections atop - News,sports,weather etc.Though the site has a llot going on in terms of information it doesnt look too cluttered to me.I regulalry use yahoo to read news,movie reviews and other interesting stuff.

	<span style="color:orange"><strong>Expedia (Mobile App):-</strong></span> I find this app super cool and easy to use. It has nice images. Booking Hotel and flights is very easy.I havent used their site as much.The Expedia app shows how images can have an effect on the site and make it look nicer.I admit I have booked couple of times on Expedia just to try out the app! I didnt really want to go anywhere.I highly recommend my friends to go and try the Expedia App.

	<span style="color:orange"><strong>NBA.com:-</strong></span> Well I dont know if I like this site because I like sports or the site itself, but this is the site I am on all the time. They have all the scores below the Header area. They show all the breaking news right below the scores followed by videos of the latest games.The Standings page also has a nice tabular section showing the latest rankings.
