<h2>My Favourite sites</h2>

<body>


<p>
	<strong>YAHOO:-</strong>This is the site I visit most often.What I like about Yahoo is the 'hover'feature that allows you to hover your mouse on the image and it displays the news piece.The 'Trending now' section shows you breaking news at one glance.It has numerous links to go to different sections atop - News,sports,weather etc.

</p>

<p><strong>Expedia (Mobile App):-</strong> I find this app super cool and easy to use. It has nice images. Booking Hotel and flights is very easy.

	<strong>NBA:-</strong> Well I dont know if I like this site because I like sports or the site itself, but this is the site I am on all the time. They have all the scores below the Header area. They show all the breaking news right below the scores followed by videos of the latest games.The Standings page also has a nice tabular section showing the latest rankings.
