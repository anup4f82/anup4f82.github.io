	<h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>

<p>The time in my life when I had a emotional conflict with someone was at my first job. I had a hard time dealing with one of my colleagues. This person had a tendency of being rude at times not only to me but everyone in the office. He would never give a straight answer when he was asked a question. It became very difficult to work with him. It was hard to react to this person since he was at a senior position.

  <p>There had been more than one occasion that I had to curb my anger and not react. But after a while, I could not keep ignoring this behavior. I decided to write to my Manager about this person and what I was going through. </p>

  <p> My Manager responded by talking to this person who in turn apologized to me. Since this incident this person's behaviour improved a bit.</p>

    <p>This incident taught me that you shouldn't let anyone push you into a corner. You need to stand your ground and find a solution with a calm mind rather than anger and frustration influencing your actions. I was proud of myself for not letting my temper take the best of me but finding a solution to deal with it.</p>
