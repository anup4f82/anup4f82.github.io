	<h1>Exploring your values</h1>

<p>When I think of the times in my life where I have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, these are the following things that come to my mind:
	<br>

	<ul <span style="color:orange">
<li>Accomplishment</li>
<li>Personal development</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Status</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Money</li>

	</ul>


</p>

<p>The value that is most important to me is Accomplishment. I feel very satisfied when I accomplish my goals - be it at work, school or playing a game. Accomplishment isn't about winning the ultimate prize. It is the satisfaction of completing a task successfully by putting in my best efforts. There have been times in my life when I know that I could have put in a little more effort and achieved my goals but I try to improve myself with every goal I set for myself.</p>


<p>In general I try to live up to these values:
<br>
		<ul <span style="color:orange">
<li>Accomplishment: 3</li>
<li>Personal development: 4</li>
<li>Competition: 3</li>
<li>Status: 3</li>
<li>Music: 3</li>
<li>Money: 4</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<p>The last topic someone asked my advice was my brother on some of the struggles he his having at MBA school. When he fist joined the school it was a big change for him having to move from Boston to Georgetown. He had no friends in Georgetown and his first month in MBA school was though. I advised him to not panic and take it easy and focus on studying. Every time you come to a new place you have to adjust and adapt and eventually you will make friends and get back to your routine life.</p>
