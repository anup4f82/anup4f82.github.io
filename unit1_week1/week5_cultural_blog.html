	<h1>Problems facing the Tech World: Burnout</h1>

<p>Today with technology moving at a rapid pace, IT employees are constantly being challenged to incorporate the new advances in their software as well. Due to the fierce competition in the technological world there is a constant need to churn out quality & new software features  to attract more customers. Every time a new technology comes into existence, IT employees are expected to learn it, master it and then produce software!</p>
<p> With complex software being developed there is also lot of possibilites of 'software bugs'. These bugs could lead to revenue loss and disconcerted customers. As a IT professional not only is creating new advanced software important but it has to be bug-free. This means thoroughly testing the software , fixing bugs and having multiple software releases.
  <p> Being in the IT industry currently I have experienced this first-hand. I personally feel IT Employees get overworked and underpaid. I hope things change in future!.
