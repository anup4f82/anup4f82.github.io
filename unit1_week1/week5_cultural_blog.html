	<h1>Problems facing the Tech World: Burnout</h1>

<p>With technology moving at such a rapid pace today, IT employees are constantly being challenged to incorporate the new advances in their software as well. The fierce competition in the technological world has created a constant need to churn out new software features to attract more customers. Every time a new technology or language is introduced in the industry, IT employees are expected to learn & master it and then reproduce the software quickly. When a business wants to use new technology, that could mean hiring new Software Engineers and often letting old Employees go. IT professionals also seem to have a short shelf-life these days.</p>
<p> With complex software being developed, there is also a high possibility of 'software bugs'. These bugs could lead to revenue loss and disconcerted customers. For a IT professional, not only is it important to create new advanced software, but also have it be bug-free. This means thoroughly testing the software, fixing bugs and having multiple software releases.
  <p> Having said all this, I'd like to say that I enjoy being in IT industry in these exciting times. One major advantage of being in this rapidly evolving space is that you are contantly pushed to learn new stuff and most of it is pretty cool!
