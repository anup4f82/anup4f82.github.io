	<h1>Sterotype Threat</h1>

<p>Stereotype threat is definitely a situation that prevails in today's time. I have personally experienced this feeling when I first moved to the States. Although I was well-versed in English and able to communicate effectively I was very conscious to express my opinions at times. During classes or in meetings, I would hold back on voicing my opinions. I think the reason for this hesitation was the fact that I was now in a new environment with a different culture as compared to where I was from, and I wasn't really sure out about how I would be perceived. Although this didn't affect my grades, it was something that bothered me.</p> <p>It is the perception that is built into us that makes us think that we aren't equal to the next person. I eventually outgrew this hesiation when I realized everyone else around me was starting at the same level and this made be more comfortable and confident as time progressed. My only recommendation for this situation is the realization that everyone else around you is feeling the same and it just takes one to break the barrier which will make everyone feel at ease.
