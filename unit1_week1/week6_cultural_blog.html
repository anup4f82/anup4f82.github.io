	<h1>Sterotype Threat</h1>

<p>Stereotype threat is definitely a situation that prevails amongst immigrants in today's time. I have personally experienced this feeling when I first moved to the States. Despite having studied in the best schools in India and being well versed in English, I faced some challenges in communicating my thoughts clearly. I felt people in the US were better at communicating in English as it was the primary language of communication. When I wouldd be in meetings or conversing with my fellow classmates/colleagues, I would have to really think carefully about what I was going to say. On the other hand, when I would be around my Indian friends, I faced no hesitation. Looking back at this, I think I might have been a victim of stereotype threat! Over the years, I have overcome my hesitation and apprehension and am able to communicate my thoughts with ease and clarity.
