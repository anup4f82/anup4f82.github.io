<p>Ruby Methods</p><br>

<p>One of the cool things about Ruby is the Enumerable Module. Collection objects in Ruby reside in the Enumberable Module. Most of the searching and querying functionality used in Ryby comes from Enumerable. Some of the commonly used Methods provided by Enumerable are: collect,map,include?,sort,reduce,group_by</p><br>

<p> The map method is one of the most powerful enumerable operations in Ruby.map will always return an array as its output.Below I have described the Enumerable map method in detail and some of its uses:</p><br>



	<p>
		<div id = "syntax">Map</div><br>The Enumerable map method is used on a array to transform its receiver based on the rules set in the code block. The output of Enumerable map method is always an Array.</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br>array.map{|item|block}</p>
         
		<p>Example:</p>
		<p> If we have an array , say <div id = "syntax">numbers = [1,2,3,4]</div><br> If we want to get an array that squares each number in the original array then we can use the map method:</p>
		<div id = "syntax">
		<p> new_numbers = [1,2,3,4].map{|x| x*2}</p>
		<p>Output: new_numbers =  [2,4,6,8]</p></div>
		<p>Another example is, Lets say we have an array <div id = "syntax">names = ["tim","tom","sam","mike"]</div><br>If we want to capitalize every element of the array, we can use the map method as below:</p>
    <div id = "syntax">
		<p>new_names = ["tim","tom","sam","mike"].map{|x| x.capitalize}</p>
    <p>Output: new_names =  ["Tim","Tom","Sam","Mike"]</p></div>
    <p>In the above cases we used the map method. Ruby also provides the map! method which is the destructive version of map. It will transform the array in place and return it.</p>
    
    <p>e.g: In the above example where we capitalize every word of the array using the map method, the value of the original array <span style="color:orange">'names' will remain ["tim","tom","sam","mike"] </span></p>
    <p>But if we use map! method, it will transform the original array as well:<br><div id = "syntax">
      names = ["tim","tom","sam","mike"]<br><br>

        new_names = names.map!{|x| x.capitalize}<br><br>

      Output:<br><br>names = ["Tim","Tom","Sam","Mike"]<br><br> new_names = ["Tim","Tom","Sam","Mike"]
</div>
     </p>

        <p> As you can see the Enumerable map method is very powerful and can be a usefool method in programming!.</p>
