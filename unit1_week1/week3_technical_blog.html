<p>Loops are used in programming to automate repetitive tasks. This is one of the most basic tasks of programming. Ruby has some of the common loops that are used by other programming languages and a few very effecient loops of it's own. The syntax for Ruby loops is very easy to write and understand. With so many options available it is sometimes hard to decide which loop to use. Ever programmer feels comfortable using one loop over the other. I personally use the 'for' and '.each' loop the most in Ruby.</p><br>

<p>Ruby provides some really smart ways to loop. Below I have listed some of the most commonly used Ruby Loops: </p><br>



	<ul>
		<li><div id = "syntax">While Loop:</div><br> A While loop is used when you want to perform a action until a certain condition is true. When the condition is false the While loop is exited. </li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br> while (condition = true) <br>code<br>end</p>

		<li><div id = "syntax">Until loop:</div><br> An Until loop is the opposite of a While. A Until loop is executed till a condition is false. When the condtion is true the loop is exited
		</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br> Until (condition = false) do<br>code<br>end</p>
		<li><div id = "syntax">For loop:</div><br> A for loop executes the code for a given range of Numbers. E.g: If you want to execute a code 10 times, this can be achieved by using a For loop by giving the number range 1..10. You can also give a condition such as n < length</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br>for i in 1..n do <br>code<br>end</p>
		<li><div id = "syntax">.times:</div><br> .times is similar to for loop with less restrictions. It is used to execute a given of code n times</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br>i.times<br>{code}<br>end</p>
		<li><div id = "syntax">.each:</div><br> .each is used to loop through all the elements of an array. </li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br>array.each do |x| {code}<br>end</p>
		<li><div id = "syntax">loop:</div><br> The Loop method is used to execute a given set of code infintely. It is crucial to have a break statement when you use 'loop' to prevent your code to run endlessly</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br>loop<br>do<br>code<br>break if (condition)<br>end</p>
	</ul>
