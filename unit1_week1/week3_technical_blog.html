<p>Loops are used in programming to automate repetitive tasks. This is one of the most basic tasks of programming. Ruby has some of the common loops that are used by other programming languages and a few very effecient loops of it's own. The syntax for Ruby loops is very easy to write and understand. With so many options available it is sometimes hard to decide which loop to use. </p><br>

<p>Ruby provides some really smart ways to loop. Here are some of the Ruby Loops </p><br>



	<ul>
		<li>While Loop: A While loop is used when you want to perform a actin until a certain condition is true. A While loop is usually used whe you want to 
		process certain piece of information till a condition is met. </li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br> while (condition = true) do<br>code<br>end</p>

		<li>Until loop: An Until loop is the opposite of a While. A Until loop is executed till a condition is false. When the condtion is true the loop is exited
		</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br> Until (condition = false) do<br>code<br>end</p>
		<li>For loop: A for loop executes the code for a given range of Numbers. E.g: If you want to execute a code 10 times, this can be achieved by using a For loop. A foor loop is useful when you know process code n times. You can also give a condition such as n < length</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br>for i in 1..n do <br>code<br>end</p>
		<li>.times: .times is similar to for loop with less restrictions. It is used to execute a given of code n times</li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br>i.times{do code}<br>code<br>end</p>
		<li>.each: .each is used to loop through all the elements of an array. </li>
		<p id = "syntax"><strong>Syntax:</strong><br><br>array.each do {|x| code} end<br>end</p>
		<li>if</li>
	</ul>
