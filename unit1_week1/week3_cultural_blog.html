	<h1>Pairing</h1>

<p>Pair Programming is something I got introduced to recently at Dev Bootcamp. Pair Programming is coming up with ideas and building code together. It is two developers thinking together coming up with the best and most effecient solution for a given task</p>

<p> My experience with Pair programming has been rewarding so far.  I have learnt some new things in my pairing sessions and also taught my pairs some new tricks they were not aware of. Some of my concepts have been solidifed as part of the pairing sessions. When you pair with another person you get to know their way of thinking and how they come up with a solution. This helps you when you are tackling a similar problem next time. Since many of us are fairly new to programming at times it was difficult to disucss some of the coding concepts. It was easier to write the code and explain than doing it verbally. I personally didn't know that pair programming is quite a common thing in the IT Industry. I have recently seen Developers at my workplace also doing Pair programming. Especially when you are a Junior developer or someone who is new at work, pair programming should be very helpful to get a kickstart and help you understand the code written by the Developers. Since Development is a team effort, pair-programming looks like a must need in order to come up with a effecient solution. It will help reduce 'Bug fixing' time in the long run!

<h1>Feedback</h1>

<p>The only feedback I have received was from my instructor. The feedback was very construtive and I have tried to inculcate the feedback in my ongoing pairing sessions. Most of the pairing sessions so far have been dealing with relatively easy assignments. Sometimes giving feedback is tough, because both you and your pair just breezed through the assignment. I am sure as we tackle more complex assignments in the following weeks, there will be a lot more to write on.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel pair programming is definetely a good practise. Sometimes while coding a complex problem, I tend to get stuck on a concept or just can't figure out why the code is not passing. Pair programming gives us the chance to share our doubts and issues with fellow programmers and get their perspective and collectively solve a problem!.
