	<h1>Pairing & Giving feedback</h1>

<p>Pair Programming is something I got introduced to recently at Dev Bootcamp. Pair Programming is coming up with ideas and building code together. It is two developers thinking together coming up with the best and most effecient solution for a given task</p>

<p> My experience with Pair programming has been rewarding so far.  I have learnt some new things in my pairing sessions and also taught my pairs some new things they were not aware of. Some of my concepts have been solidifed as part of the pairing sessions. When you pair with anothe person you get to know their way of thinking and how they come up with a solution. This helps you when you are tackling a similar problem next time. Since many of us are fairly new to programming at times it was difficult to disucss some of the coding concepts. It was easier to write the code and explain than doing it verbally. 

<p>The only feedback I have received was from my instructor. The feedback was very construtive and I have tried to inculcate the feedback in my ongoing pairing sessions. All my pairing sessions have gone well so far. So giving feedback was not hard. For couple of my pairing sessions I did notice a few things that my pair could improve on and I mentioned that in my feedback.</p>
